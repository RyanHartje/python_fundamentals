## Variables

Variables are similar to math. They are usually words describing their value, like `tire_pressure`, `temperature`, or `name`. They are assigned values with the `=` operator:
```py
car_value=3000
```

There are many different kinds of variables. One notable kind is the constant, or `const`. It is used to declare a value that *can't* be modified. It's declaration looks like this:

```py
const freezing_point = 32 
```

In the example above, we are creating a constant variable, but we're assigning our variable, `freezing_point` an integer, or `int` value. This makes `freezing_point` both an `int`, and a `const`.
